# 🧠 Text Summarization NLP Project

This project demonstrates how to perform **automatic text summarization** using both **extractive** and **abstractive** methods with **NLP** and **transformer models**.

## 🚀 Objective

To create a system that can convert lengthy news articles, blogs, and reports into concise and coherent summaries.

## 📦 Dataset

- Used examples inspired by the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**.
- You can use your own custom articles or datasets for testing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- spaCy (for extractive summarization)
- HuggingFace Transformers (BART model for abstractive summarization)
- NLTK (for sentence tokenization)

## 📑 Features

- Text Preprocessing
- Extractive summarization using keyword scoring and sentence ranking
- Abstractive summarization using `facebook/bart-large-cnn`
